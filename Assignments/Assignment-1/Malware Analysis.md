# Technical Write-Up

The malware is distributed via a .doc file claiming to be from the BU IT Help Center, containing a VBA Script.

The VBA Script first checks to see if "C:\malware\ch0nky.txt" exists. If it doesn't exist, the malware simply kills the winword (Microsoft Word) process, displaying a message that says - "A critical Error has been encountered!"

If it does exist, it downloads a file from "https://ch0nky.chickenkiller.com/login.exe" as User-Agent "ch0nky", saving it in the temp directory as "microsoft.exe", then runs microsoft.exe via a hidden window.

The SHA256 hash for this "microsoft.exe" file is 61a8246e02492ccdcf4283fd746fb8dfef56053f29e6e62dcaf3075c2c6e6c4f. It has a icon image of the iconic doge.

"microsoft.exe" first checks to see if "C:\malware\ch0nky.txt" exists. If it doesn't exist, the malware displays a MessageBox saying "Sorry. You are not a winner" with a button "Sad". If it does exist, the malware displays a MessageBox saying "Congratulations on winning!" and a button saying "Wow".

It also downloads a file from "http://ch0nky.chickenkiller.com/update.exe", saving it as "MicrosoftUpdate.exe" in a certain location, and deleting the cache entry for the URL. This executable seems to contain a large resource - on static analysis, it seems to play an audio file stored as the resource.

The SHA256 hash for this "MicrosoftUpdate.exe" file is 68474c5c2279acbda9549451fa10bfdf08e36bb1f683ba83f6dfe18c1bc7c1fd.
