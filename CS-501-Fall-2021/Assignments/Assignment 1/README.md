# Assignment 1

# Solve the Crackmes:

# Reversing 101
Students at Boston University have recently been receiving some peculiar email attachments from a presumably hacked student account. The document appears to have macros, and was flagged by Windows Defender. Without Tipping off the attacker that we are on to them, analyze the Word document and determine it's IOCs. Repeat this process on all of the downloaded malware. Be warned though, you should ensure that your VM is not internet connected.  Be careful running the payloads.

The password to unzip the Document is `ch0nky`

Good Luck!
